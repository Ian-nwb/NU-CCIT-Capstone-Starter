## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js + Express.js (CommonJS) |
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| Mobile | Flutter (Dart) |
| Database | MongoDB (local via Docker **or** MongoDB Atlas) |

| Infrastructure | Docker + Docker Compose (optional) |
| Novelty | _(team-defined — see below)_ |

---

## 🗂 Folder Breakdown

### `backend/`
Express.js REST API using **CommonJS** (`require`/`module.exports`). Houses the **Models** (Mongoose schemas), **Controllers** (route handlers), and **Routes**. Connects to MongoDB via `MONGO_URI` in `.env` — this can point to a local Docker instance or directly to Atlas.

### `frontend/`
React web app scaffolded with **Vite**. The browser-based **View** layer that consumes the backend REST API.

### `mobile/`
**Flutter** mobile application (Dart). Cross-platform — builds to Android and iOS — and communicates with the same backend API.

### `infra/`
**Optional.** Docker Compose configuration that spins up:
- **MongoDB** — local database
- **Mongo Express** — a web-based MongoDB admin UI

Skip this folder entirely if you're using MongoDB Atlas — see [Database Setup](#-database-setup-choose-one) below.

### `novelty(rename to your novelty)/`
> ⚠️ **Intentionally left empty.**

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine before proceeding:

| Tool | Download | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| Git | https://git-scm.com | Always |
| Node.js (v18+) | https://nodejs.org | Always |
| Docker Desktop | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop | **Only if using local MongoDB** |
| Flutter SDK | https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install | Mobile |
| MongoDB Compass | https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass | **Optional — GUI for browsing/querying your DB (local or Atlas)** |

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ian-nwb/NU-CCIT-MVC-Capstone-Starter.git
cd NU-CCIT-Capstone-Starter
```

---

### 2. 🗄 Database Setup (choose one)

#### Option A — MongoDB Atlas (no Docker required)

1. Create a free account: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Set up a free **M0 cluster**
3. Under **Database Access**, create a database user with a username and password
4. Under **Network Access**, add your IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` to allow all — restrict this in production)
5. Click **Connect → Drivers**, copy the connection string:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
6. Paste it as `MONGO_URI` in `backend/.env` (see step 3 below)

You can skip `infra/` entirely with this option — no Docker needed. Use Atlas's built-in Data Explorer, or connect with **MongoDB Compass** using the same `mongodb+srv://` string from step 5 (Atlas also has a "Connect → Compass" shortcut that gives you a ready-made connection string).

#### Option B — Local MongoDB via Docker

```bash
cd infra
docker compose up -d
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| MongoDB | `mongodb://localhost:27018` |
| Mongo Express (admin UI) | http://localhost:8081 |

> Make sure Docker Desktop is running before this step.

You can also connect with **MongoDB Compass** using `mongodb://localhost:27018` for a richer GUI than Mongo Express (schema view, index management, aggregation pipeline builder, etc.).

To stop the containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```

---

### 3. Run the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `MONGO_URI` in `.env` to either your Atlas connection string (Option A) or the local Docker URI (Option B), then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Express API will be available at **http://localhost:3000** (or whichever port is set in your `.env`).

---

### 4. Run the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The React + Vite app will be available at **http://localhost:5173**.

> Set the backend API URL in your frontend `.env`:
> ```
> VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
> ```

---

### 5. Run the Mobile App (Flutter)

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

> Make sure a device or emulator is running first. To list available devices:
> ```bash
> flutter devices
> ```

Update the API base URL in your Flutter project (typically in `lib/config/` or `lib/constants/`) to point to the running backend.

---

### 6. (Optional) Run the Novelty Layer

Refer to the `novelty/README.md` created by your team for setup instructions specific to your chosen technology.

## 🔄 Running Everything Together

**With Atlas (no Docker):**

| Terminal | Command |
|---|---|
| 1 — Backend | `cd backend && npm run dev` |
| 2 — Frontend | `cd frontend && npm run dev` |
| 3 — Mobile | `cd mobile && flutter run` |

**With local Docker MongoDB:**

| Terminal | Command |
|---|---|
| 1 — Infra | `cd infra && docker compose up -d` |
| 2 — Backend | `cd backend && npm run dev` |
| 3 — Frontend | `cd frontend && npm run dev` |
| 4 — Mobile | `cd mobile && flutter run` |

---

## 🧭 Using MongoDB Compass (optional, either setup)

[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) is a desktop GUI for exploring and querying your data outside of Mongo Express / Atlas Data Explorer.

1. Download and install Compass
2. Open Compass and paste your connection string:
   - Local Docker: `mongodb://localhost:27018`
   - Atlas: the `mongodb+srv://...` string from Atlas → **Connect → Compass**
3. Click **Connect** to browse databases, collections, and documents, run queries, and build aggregation pipelines visually

---

## ☁️ Deployment — MongoDB Atlas

For actual deployment, use **MongoDB Atlas** regardless of which option you chose locally (free tier available). See [Database Setup — Option A](#option-a--mongodb-atlas-no-docker-required) above for account/cluster steps.

> Once connected to Atlas, the `infra/` Docker setup is only needed for local development. Mongo Express is a local admin tool and is not used in production. MongoDB Compass works with both local and Atlas connections, so it's a good universal admin tool to keep around.
